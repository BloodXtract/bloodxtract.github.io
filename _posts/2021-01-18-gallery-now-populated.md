This website launched with an [Images gallery](/images), but we only had 2 random GTA Online images there.

Now, that's changed. I've gone through my steam media, as well as a fair bit of my local drive screenshots, and then added them to this website.  
As a result, our [Images gallery](/images) now has a total of ***174*** (!) new images from multiple games, for example [Guild Wars 2](/games/guildwars2), EVE Online and others. And I hope it'll get even more as the time goes!

Many new screenshots is the biggest change on the website, but there's also some more smaller updates:
- [TheDutchMagikarp](/members/TheDutchMagikarp) and [Keli](/members/Keldingull) now have their member pages.
- [Guild Wars 2](/games/guildwars2) now has some content on its page.
- Multiple games on [games list](/games) now have short descriptions.
- Some other small tweaks!
